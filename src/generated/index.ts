   * ``` <quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
   *
   * 	(Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
   *
   * <digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" | "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei
   *
   * 	(International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
   *
   * <decimalSI>       ::= m | "" | k | M | G | T | P | E
   *
   * 	(Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
   *
   * <decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber> ```
   *
   * No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.
   *
   * When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.
   *
   * Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
   *
   * - No precision is lost - No fractional digits will be emitted - The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
   *
   * The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.
   *
   * Examples:
   *
   * - 1.5 will be serialized as "1500m" - 1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"
   *
   * Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.
   *
   * Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)
   *
   * This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

     *     non-intersecting elements in `Y` are appended, retaining their partial order.
     *   - 'map': `X + Y` performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in `X` are preserved but the values
     *     are overwritten by values in `Y` when the key sets of `X` and `Y` intersect. Elements in `Y` with

The value is null for CREATE requests. - 'request' - Attributes of the API request([ref](/pkg/apis/admission/types.go#AdmissionRequest)). - 'params' - Parameter resource referred to by the policy binding being evaluated. Only populated if the policy has a ParamKind. - 'namespaceObject' - The namespace object that the incoming object belongs to. The value is null for cluster-scoped resources. - 'variables' - Map of composited variables, from its name to its lazily evaluated value.
     *   For example, a variable named 'foo' can be accessed as 'variables.foo'.
     * - 'authorizer' - A CEL Authorizer. May be used to perform authorization checks for the principal (user or service account) of the request.
     *   See https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/cel/library#Authz

     *
     * The `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object. No other metadata properties are accessible.

     *   - 'map': `X + Y` performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in `X` are preserved but the values

The `self` variable in the CEL expression is bound to the scoped value. Example: - Rule scoped to the root of a resource with a status subresource: {"rule": "self.status.actual <= self.spec.maxDesired"}
     *
     * If the Rule is scoped to an object with properties, the accessible properties of the object are field selectable via `self.field` and field presence can be checked via `has(self.field)`. Null valued fields are treated as absent fields in CEL expressions. If the Rule is scoped to an object with additionalProperties (i.e. a map) the value of the map are accessible via `self[mapKey]`, map containment can be checked via `mapKey in self` and all entries of the map are accessible via CEL macros and functions such as `self.all(...)`. If the Rule is scoped to an array, the elements of the array are accessible via `self[i]` and also by macros and functions. If the Rule is scoped to a scalar, `self` is bound to the scalar value. Examples: - Rule scoped to a map of objects: {"rule": "self.components['Widget'].priority < 10"} - Rule scoped to a list of integers: {"rule": "self.values.all(value, value >= 0 && value < 100)"} - Rule scoped to a string value: {"rule": "self.startsWith('kube')"}
     *
     * The `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object and from any x-kubernetes-embedded-resource annotated objects. No other metadata properties are accessible.
     *
     * Unknown data preserved in custom resources via x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields is not accessible in CEL expressions. This includes: - Unknown field values that are preserved by object schemas with x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields. - Object properties where the property schema is of an "unknown type". An "unknown type" is recursively defined as:
     *   - A schema with no type and x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields set to true
     *   - An array where the items schema is of an "unknown type"
     *   - An object where the additionalProperties schema is of an "unknown type"
     *
     * Only property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible. Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression: - '__' escapes to '__underscores__' - '.' escapes to '__dot__' - '-' escapes to '__dash__' - '/' escapes to '__slash__' - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '__{keyword}__'. The keywords are:
     * 	  "true", "false", "null", "in", "as", "break", "const", "continue", "else", "for", "function", "if",
     * 	  "import", "let", "loop", "package", "namespace", "return".
     * Examples:
     *   - Rule accessing a property named "namespace": {"rule": "self.__namespace__ > 0"}
     *   - Rule accessing a property named "x-prop": {"rule": "self.x__dash__prop > 0"}
     *   - Rule accessing a property named "redact__d": {"rule": "self.redact__underscores__d > 0"}
     *
     * Equality on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1]. Concatenation on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type use the semantics of the list type:
     *   - 'set': `X + Y` performs a union where the array positions of all elements in `X` are preserved and
     *     non-intersecting elements in `Y` are appended, retaining their partial order.
     *   - 'map': `X + Y` performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in `X` are preserved but the values
     *     are overwritten by values in `Y` when the key sets of `X` and `Y` intersect. Elements in `Y` with
     *     non-intersecting keys are appended, retaining their partial order.

     * * `sync`
     * * `strict-sync`
     * * `sync-all`
     * * `strict-sync-all`
     *
     * ### `async` Mode
     *
     * When in asynchronous mode the cluster is allowed to lose some committed transactions.
     *  When the primary server fails or becomes unavailable for any other reason a sufficiently healthy standby
     *  will automatically be promoted to primary. Any transactions that have not been replicated to that standby
     *  remain in a "forked timeline" on the primary, and are effectively unrecoverable (the data is still there,
     *  but recovering it requires a manual recovery effort by data recovery specialists).
     *
     * ### `sync` Mode
     *
     * When in synchronous mode a standby will not be promoted unless it is certain that the standby contains all
     *  transactions that may have returned a successful commit status to client (clients can change the behavior
     *  per transaction using PostgreSQL’s `synchronous_commit` setting. Transactions with `synchronous_commit`
     *  values of `off` and `local` may be lost on fail over, but will not be blocked by replication delays). This
     *  means that the system may be unavailable for writes even though some servers are available. System
     *  administrators can still use manual failover commands to promote a standby even if it results in transaction
     *  loss.
     *
     * Synchronous mode does not guarantee multi node durability of commits under all circumstances. When no suitable
     *  standby is available, primary server will still accept writes, but does not guarantee their replication. When
     *  the primary fails in this mode no standby will be promoted. When the host that used to be the primary comes
     *  back it will get promoted automatically, unless system administrator performed a manual failover. This behavior
     *  makes synchronous mode usable with 2 node clusters.
     *
     * When synchronous mode is used and a standby crashes, commits will block until the primary is switched to standalone
     *  mode. Manually shutting down or restarting a standby will not cause a commit service interruption. Standby will
     *  signal the primary to release itself from synchronous standby duties before PostgreSQL shutdown is initiated.
     *
     * ### `strict-sync` Mode
     *
     * When it is absolutely necessary to guarantee that each write is stored durably on at least two nodes, use the strict
     *  synchronous mode. This mode prevents synchronous replication to be switched off on the primary when no synchronous
     *  standby candidates are available. As a downside, the primary will not be available for writes (unless the Postgres
     *  transaction explicitly turns off `synchronous_mode` parameter), blocking all client write requests until at least one
     *  synchronous replica comes up.
     *
     * **Note**: Because of the way synchronous replication is implemented in PostgreSQL it is still possible to lose
     *  transactions even when using strict synchronous mode. If the PostgreSQL backend is cancelled while waiting to acknowledge
     *  replication (as a result of packet cancellation due to client timeout or backend failure) transaction changes become
     *  visible for other backends. Such changes are not yet replicated and may be lost in case of standby promotion.
     *
     * ### `sync-all` Mode
     *
     * The same as `sync` but `syncInstances` is ignored and the number of synchronous instances is equals to the total number
     *  of instances less one.
     *
     * ### `strict-sync-all` Mode
     *
     * The same as `strict-sync` but `syncInstances` is ignored and the number of synchronous instances is equals to the total number
     *  of instances less one.

     * Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.
     *
     * The serialization format is:
     *
     * <quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
     *   (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
     * <digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" | "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei
     *   (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
     * <decimalSI>       ::= m | "" | k | M | G | T | P | E
     *   (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
     * <decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber>
     *
     * No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.
     *
     * When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.
     *
     * Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
     *   a. No precision is lost
     *   b. No fractional digits will be emitted
     *   c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
     * The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.
     *
     * Examples:
     *   1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
     *   1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"
     *
     * Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.
     *
     * Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)
     *
     * This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

     * * `sync-all`
     * * `strict-sync-all`
     *
     * ### `async` Mode
     *
     * When in asynchronous mode the cluster is allowed to lose some committed transactions.
     *  When the primary server fails or becomes unavailable for any other reason a sufficiently healthy standby
     *  will automatically be promoted to primary. Any transactions that have not been replicated to that standby
     *  remain in a "forked timeline" on the primary, and are effectively unrecoverable (the data is still there,
     *  but recovering it requires a manual recovery effort by data recovery specialists).
     *
     * ### `sync` Mode
     *
     * When in synchronous mode a standby will not be promoted unless it is certain that the standby contains all
     *  transactions that may have returned a successful commit status to client (clients can change the behavior
     *  per transaction using PostgreSQL’s `synchronous_commit` setting. Transactions with `synchronous_commit`
     *  values of `off` and `local` may be lost on fail over, but will not be blocked by replication delays). This
     *  means that the system may be unavailable for writes even though some servers are available. System
     *  administrators can still use manual failover commands to promote a standby even if it results in transaction
     *  loss.
     *
     * Synchronous mode does not guarantee multi node durability of commits under all circumstances. When no suitable
     *  standby is available, primary server will still accept writes, but does not guarantee their replication. When
     *  the primary fails in this mode no standby will be promoted. When the host that used to be the primary comes
     *  back it will get promoted automatically, unless system administrator performed a manual failover. This behavior
     *  makes synchronous mode usable with 2 node clusters.
     *
     * When synchronous mode is used and a standby crashes, commits will block until the primary is switched to standalone
     *  mode. Manually shutting down or restarting a standby will not cause a commit service interruption. Standby will
     *  signal the primary to release itself from synchronous standby duties before PostgreSQL shutdown is initiated.
     *
     * ### `strict-sync` Mode
     *
     * When it is absolutely necessary to guarantee that each write is stored durably on at least two nodes, use the strict
     *  synchronous mode. This mode prevents synchronous replication to be switched off on the primary when no synchronous
     *  standby candidates are available. As a downside, the primary will not be available for writes (unless the Postgres
     *  transaction explicitly turns off `synchronous_mode` parameter), blocking all client write requests until at least one
     *  synchronous replica comes up.
     *
     * **Note**: Because of the way synchronous replication is implemented in PostgreSQL it is still possible to lose
     *  transactions even when using strict synchronous mode. If the PostgreSQL backend is cancelled while waiting to acknowledge
     *  replication (as a result of packet cancellation due to client timeout or backend failure) transaction changes become
     *  visible for other backends. Such changes are not yet replicated and may be lost in case of standby promotion.
     *
     * ### `sync-all` Mode
     *
     * The same as `sync` but `syncInstances` is ignored and the number of synchronous instances is equals to the total number
     *  of instances less one.

     * Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.

     *
     * <quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
     *   (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
     * <digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" | "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei
     *   (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
     * <decimalSI>       ::= m | "" | k | M | G | T | P | E
     *   (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
     * <decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber>
     *
     * No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.
     *
     * When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.
     *
     * Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
     *   a. No precision is lost
     *   b. No fractional digits will be emitted
     *   c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
     * The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.
     *
     * Examples:
     *   1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
     *   1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"
     *
     * Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.
     *
     * Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)
     *
     * This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

     * <digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" | "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei
     *   (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
     * <decimalSI>       ::= m | "" | k | M | G | T | P | E
     *   (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
     * <decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber>
     *
     * No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.
     *
     * When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.
     *
     * Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
     *   a. No precision is lost
     *   b. No fractional digits will be emitted
     *   c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
     * The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.
     *
     * Examples:
     *   1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
     *   1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"
     *
     * Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.
     *
     * Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)
     *
     * This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

     * Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.
     *
     * The serialization format is:
     *
     * <quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
     *   (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
     * <digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" | "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei
     *   (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
     * <decimalSI>       ::= m | "" | k | M | G | T | P | E
     *   (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
     * <decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber>
     *
     * No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.
     *
     * When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.
     *
     * Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
     *   a. No precision is lost
     *   b. No fractional digits will be emitted
     *   c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
     * The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.
     *
     * Examples:
     *   1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
     *   1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"
     *
     * Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.
     *
     * Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)
     *
     * This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

     * The replication mode applied to the whole cluster.
     * Possible values are:
     * * `async`
     * * `sync`
     * * `strict-sync`
     * * `sync-all` (default)
     * * `strict-sync-all`
     *
     * ### `async` Mode
     *
     * When in asynchronous mode the cluster is allowed to lose some committed transactions.
     *  When the primary server fails or becomes unavailable for any other reason a sufficiently healthy standby
     *  will automatically be promoted to primary. Any transactions that have not been replicated to that standby
     *  remain in a "forked timeline" on the primary, and are effectively unrecoverable (the data is still there,
     *  but recovering it requires a manual recovery effort by data recovery specialists).
     *
     * ### `sync` Mode
     *
     * When in synchronous mode a standby will not be promoted unless it is certain that the standby contains all
     *  transactions that may have returned a successful commit status to client (clients can change the behavior
     *  per transaction using PostgreSQL’s `synchronous_commit` setting. Transactions with `synchronous_commit`
     *  values of `off` and `local` may be lost on fail over, but will not be blocked by replication delays). This
     *  means that the system may be unavailable for writes even though some servers are available. System
     *  administrators can still use manual failover commands to promote a standby even if it results in transaction
     *  loss.
     *
     * Synchronous mode does not guarantee multi node durability of commits under all circumstances. When no suitable
     *  standby is available, primary server will still accept writes, but does not guarantee their replication. When
     *  the primary fails in this mode no standby will be promoted. When the host that used to be the primary comes
     *  back it will get promoted automatically, unless system administrator performed a manual failover. This behavior
     *  makes synchronous mode usable with 2 node clusters.
     *
     * When synchronous mode is used and a standby crashes, commits will block until the primary is switched to standalone
     *  mode. Manually shutting down or restarting a standby will not cause a commit service interruption. Standby will
     *  signal the primary to release itself from synchronous standby duties before PostgreSQL shutdown is initiated.
     *
     * ### `strict-sync` Mode
     *
     * When it is absolutely necessary to guarantee that each write is stored durably on at least two nodes, use the strict
     *  synchronous mode. This mode prevents synchronous replication to be switched off on the primary when no synchronous
     *  standby candidates are available. As a downside, the primary will not be available for writes (unless the Postgres
     *  transaction explicitly turns off `synchronous_mode` parameter), blocking all client write requests until at least one
     *  synchronous replica comes up.
     *
     * **Note**: Because of the way synchronous replication is implemented in PostgreSQL it is still possible to lose
     *  transactions even when using strict synchronous mode. If the PostgreSQL backend is cancelled while waiting to acknowledge
     *  replication (as a result of packet cancellation due to client timeout or backend failure) transaction changes become
     *  visible for other backends. Such changes are not yet replicated and may be lost in case of standby promotion.
     *
     * ### `sync-all` Mode
     *
     * The same as `sync` but `syncInstances` is ignored and the number of synchronous instances is equals to the total number
     *  of instances less one.
     *
     * ### `strict-sync-all` Mode
     *
     * The same as `strict-sync` but `syncInstances` is ignored and the number of synchronous instances is equals to the total number
     *  of instances less one.

     * Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.
     *
     * The serialization format is:
     *
     * <quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
     *   (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
     * <digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" | "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei
     *   (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
     * <decimalSI>       ::= m | "" | k | M | G | T | P | E
     *   (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
     * <decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber>
     *
     * No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.
     *
     * When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.
     *
     * Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
     *   a. No precision is lost
     *   b. No fractional digits will be emitted
     *   c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
     * The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.
     *
     * Examples:
     *   1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
     *   1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"
     *
     * Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.
     *
     * Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)
     *
     * This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

     * Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.
     *
     * The serialization format is:
     *
     * <quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
     *   (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
     * <digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" | "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei
     *   (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
     * <decimalSI>       ::= m | "" | k | M | G | T | P | E
     *   (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
     * <decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber>
     *
     * No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.
     *
     * When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.
     *
     * Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
     *   a. No precision is lost
     *   b. No fractional digits will be emitted
     *   c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
     * The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.
     *
     * Examples:
     *   1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
     *   1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"
     *
     * Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.
     *
     * Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)
     *
     * This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

     * * `sync`
     * * `strict-sync`
     * * `sync-all`
     * * `strict-sync-all`
     *
     * ### `async` Mode
     *
     * When in asynchronous mode the cluster is allowed to lose some committed transactions.
     *  When the primary server fails or becomes unavailable for any other reason a sufficiently healthy standby
     *  will automatically be promoted to primary. Any transactions that have not been replicated to that standby
     *  remain in a "forked timeline" on the primary, and are effectively unrecoverable (the data is still there,
     *  but recovering it requires a manual recovery effort by data recovery specialists).
     *
     * ### `sync` Mode
     *
     * When in synchronous mode a standby will not be promoted unless it is certain that the standby contains all
     *  transactions that may have returned a successful commit status to client (clients can change the behavior
     *  per transaction using PostgreSQL’s `synchronous_commit` setting. Transactions with `synchronous_commit`
     *  values of `off` and `local` may be lost on fail over, but will not be blocked by replication delays). This
     *  means that the system may be unavailable for writes even though some servers are available. System
     *  administrators can still use manual failover commands to promote a standby even if it results in transaction
     *  loss.
     *
     * Synchronous mode does not guarantee multi node durability of commits under all circumstances. When no suitable
     *  standby is available, primary server will still accept writes, but does not guarantee their replication. When
     *  the primary fails in this mode no standby will be promoted. When the host that used to be the primary comes
     *  back it will get promoted automatically, unless system administrator performed a manual failover. This behavior
     *  makes synchronous mode usable with 2 node clusters.
     *
     * When synchronous mode is used and a standby crashes, commits will block until the primary is switched to standalone
     *  mode. Manually shutting down or restarting a standby will not cause a commit service interruption. Standby will
     *  signal the primary to release itself from synchronous standby duties before PostgreSQL shutdown is initiated.
     *
     * ### `strict-sync` Mode
     *
     * When it is absolutely necessary to guarantee that each write is stored durably on at least two nodes, use the strict
     *  synchronous mode. This mode prevents synchronous replication to be switched off on the primary when no synchronous
     *  standby candidates are available. As a downside, the primary will not be available for writes (unless the Postgres
     *  transaction explicitly turns off `synchronous_mode` parameter), blocking all client write requests until at least one
     *  synchronous replica comes up.
     *
     * **Note**: Because of the way synchronous replication is implemented in PostgreSQL it is still possible to lose
     *  transactions even when using strict synchronous mode. If the PostgreSQL backend is cancelled while waiting to acknowledge
     *  replication (as a result of packet cancellation due to client timeout or backend failure) transaction changes become
     *  visible for other backends. Such changes are not yet replicated and may be lost in case of standby promotion.
     *
     * ### `sync-all` Mode
     *
     * The same as `sync` but `syncInstances` is ignored and the number of synchronous instances is equals to the total number
     *  of instances less one.
     *
     * ### `strict-sync-all` Mode
     *
     * The same as `strict-sync` but `syncInstances` is ignored and the number of synchronous instances is equals to the total number
     *  of instances less one.

     * Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.
     *
     * The serialization format is:
     *
     * <quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
     *   (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
     * <digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" | "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei
     *   (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
     * <decimalSI>       ::= m | "" | k | M | G | T | P | E
     *   (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
     * <decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber>
     *
     * No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.
     *
     * When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.
     *
     * Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
     *   a. No precision is lost
     *   b. No fractional digits will be emitted
     *   c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
     * The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.
     *
     * Examples:
     *   1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
     *   1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"
     *
     * Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.
     *
     * Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)
     *
     * This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

     *  means that the system may be unavailable for writes even though some servers are available. System
     *  administrators can still use manual failover commands to promote a standby even if it results in transaction
     *  loss.
     *
     * Synchronous mode does not guarantee multi node durability of commits under all circumstances. When no suitable
     *  standby is available, primary server will still accept writes, but does not guarantee their replication. When
     *  the primary fails in this mode no standby will be promoted. When the host that used to be the primary comes
     *  back it will get promoted automatically, unless system administrator performed a manual failover. This behavior
     *  makes synchronous mode usable with 2 node clusters.
     *
     * When synchronous mode is used and a standby crashes, commits will block until the primary is switched to standalone
     *  mode. Manually shutting down or restarting a standby will not cause a commit service interruption. Standby will
     *  signal the primary to release itself from synchronous standby duties before PostgreSQL shutdown is initiated.
     *
     * ### `strict-sync` Mode
     *
     * When it is absolutely necessary to guarantee that each write is stored durably on at least two nodes, use the strict
     *  synchronous mode. This mode prevents synchronous replication to be switched off on the primary when no synchronous
     *  standby candidates are available. As a downside, the primary will not be available for writes (unless the Postgres
     *  transaction explicitly turns off `synchronous_mode` parameter), blocking all client write requests until at least one
     *  synchronous replica comes up.
     *
     * **Note**: Because of the way synchronous replication is implemented in PostgreSQL it is still possible to lose
     *  transactions even when using strict synchronous mode. If the PostgreSQL backend is cancelled while waiting to acknowledge
     *  replication (as a result of packet cancellation due to client timeout or backend failure) transaction changes become
     *  visible for other backends. Such changes are not yet replicated and may be lost in case of standby promotion.
     *
     * ### `sync-all` Mode
     *
     * The same as `sync` but `syncInstances` is ignored and the number of synchronous instances is equals to the total number
     *  of instances less one.
     *
     * ### `strict-sync-all` Mode
     *
     * The same as `strict-sync` but `syncInstances` is ignored and the number of synchronous instances is equals to the total number
     *  of instances less one.
